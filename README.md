# Exam Application

## Project Description

The **Exam Application** is a web-based tool built with Next.js (TypeScript) that allows users to take an exam within a 1-hour duration. Users can select answers, flag questions for later review, and must complete at least 50% of the exam to submit. The application stores user answers and progress in `localStorage`, preventing data loss on page refresh. Once the timer hits zero, users are automatically redirected to a static result page that shows their completion status. The frontend is styled using Shadcn and Tailwind CSS, and the project is hosted on Vercel.
